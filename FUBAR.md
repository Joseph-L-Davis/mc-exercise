### Hello!
## Here I Am
# Rockin like a hurricane!

Once upon a time, there was a dragon. The dragon was lonely, so it sought out some gold to keep it company.

When it finally found a pile of gold, some humans tried to shoot it with arrows. Obviously scared for its life, the dragon tried to scare the humans away with its fire.
